# Project Overview

## Project Name

poke-duel

## Project Description
I'll be recreating/revamping the clasic hand-held game we all know and love, Pokémon. In this app you will be able to pull data from my airtable api and use that data as a playable character to face your opponent. You'll also be able to add in Pokémon that aren't yet in the roster and give them special attacks. Player's will also have the ability to edit the characters we offer.
